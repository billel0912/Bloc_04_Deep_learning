AT&T is a large telecommunications company based in Dallas, Texas. They are looking for an automated solution to detect spam messages and protect their users. The goal of this project is to build a spam detector that can automatically flag spam messages based on their content. The dataset for this project contains messages classified as “spam” and “ham” and is relatively small with 5566 lines. Transfer learning from a sophisticated model trained on more data might help improve performance. The deliverables for this project include a notebook with all necessary preprocessing and one or more Deep Learning models to predict the nature of messages as spam or ham, using libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Tensorflow, and Transformers.
